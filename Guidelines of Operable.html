<h1> Operable Principle</h1>
<p>The principle of Operable is the second guideline of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and ensures that all users can interact with and navigate a website or application. This principle focuses on making user interface components and navigation operable for everyone, including users who rely on assistive technologies or alternative input devices.</p>
<p>Under the Operable principle, there are five guidelines that help ensure digital content is accessible to all users, including those with motor impairments, cognitive limitations, and other disabilities affecting physical interaction. These guidelines are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Keyboard Accessible - Make all functionality available from a keyboard so that users who cannot use a mouse can still interact with content. This includes ensuring users can navigate, operate buttons, and access all content using only the keyboard.</li>
<li>Enough Time - Provide users with enough time to read and use content. Avoid time limits that can cause stress or prevent completion of tasks, or provide mechanisms to extend or turn off time limits.</li>
<li>Seizures and Physical Reactions - Avoid content that can cause seizures or physical reactions. This includes limiting flashing content and animations that could trigger discomfort or adverse reactions in sensitive users.</li>
<li>Navigable - Help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are. This involves clear page titles, logical heading structures, visible focus indicators, and multiple ways to reach pages.</li>
<li>Input Modalities - Make it easier for users to operate functionality using different types of inputs beyond the keyboard, such as touch, voice, or assistive technologies like switch devices.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these guidelines includes several Success Criteria that provide measurable requirements for compliance at different WCAG levels (A, AA, AAA). These criteria support the development of content that is usable for people with limited mobility, slow reaction time, or reliance on non-traditional input methods.</p>

<h2>Examples of Guideline 2.1: Keyboard Accessible</h2>
<p>Guideline 2.1 of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) focuses on ensuring that all functionality on a website or application can be accessed using a keyboard. This is essential for users who cannot use a mouse, including those with motor disabilities and screen reader users. The goal is to allow full interaction with digital content through keyboard-only navigation.</p>
<p>Here are examples of how to meet Guideline 2.1:</p>
<ol>
<li>2.1.1 Keyboard (A)</li>
<p>All functionality must be operable through a keyboard interface without requiring specific timing for individual keystrokes. Example: A user navigates a contact form using the Tab key. They can enter text, select checkboxes, choose options from a dropdown, and press Enter to submit the form.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Example: The color selection tool supports keyboard navigation using arrow keys to move between colors and Enter to select.</li>
<li>Bad Example: A color selection tool can only be used by clicking with a mouse, with no keyboard functionality.</li>
</ul>
<li>2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap (A)</li>
<p>If a component can be focused using the keyboard, then the user must be able to move focus away from it using standard keyboard commands like Tab or Shift+Tab. Example: A modal dialog pops up on the screen for feedback. The user can navigate inside it using Tab, press Esc to close it, and continue navigating the page.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Example: The modal allows users to navigate within it and provides a clear way to close it or move focus out.</li>
<li>Bad Example: The user enters a modal but can’t tab out or close it, getting stuck inside.</li>
</ul>
<li>2.1.3 Keyboard (No Exception) (AAA)</li>
<p>All content and functionality must be operable via a keyboard interface, with no exceptions—even for complex features like drawing tools, drag-and-drop, or games. Example: A web-based drawing app allows users to select tools, draw on a canvas, and save their work using keyboard shortcuts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Example: The same tool supports keyboard controls for selecting elements, navigating the canvas, and activating commands.</li>
<li>Bad Example: A diagramming tool only allows mouse interaction and offers no keyboard support.</li>
</ul>
<li>2.1.4 Character Key Shortcuts (A)</li>
<p>If a keyboard shortcut uses only character keys (like letters, numbers, or punctuation), and it is active when the component has focus, then the user must be able to turn it off, remap it, or it should only be active when the component is in focus. Example: An email web app includes a shortcut where pressing the "D" key deletes a message. The shortcut only works when the user is focused inside the message list, and users can change or disable it in settings.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Example: The "D" shortcut is only active when the message list is focused, and users can disable or remap it in the settings menu.</li>
<li>Bad Example: Pressing the "D" key anywhere on the page deletes a message, even when typing in a search field or a form.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<h2>Examples of Guideline 2.2: Enough Time</h2>
<p>Guideline 2.2 of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) ensures that users have enough time to read and interact with content. This is particularly important for people with cognitive, motor, or visual impairments who may need more time to complete tasks or understand information before it disappears or changes.</p>
<p>Here are examples of how to meet Guideline 2.2:</p>
<ol>
<li>2.2.1 Timing Adjustable (A)</li>
<p>If a time limit is set, users must be able to turn it off, adjust it, or extend it—unless the time limit is essential. Example: A quiz app gives users 30 seconds per question but includes a settings option to extend the time to 2 minutes or disable the timer entirely.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Example: The site warns users 1 minute before timeout and provides a button to extend their session.</li>
<li>Bad Example: An online form logs users out after 5 minutes of inactivity with no warning or option to extend the session.</li>
</ul>
<li>2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide (A)</li>
<p>Users must be able to pause, stop, or hide content that moves, blinks, scrolls, or auto-updates and lasts more than 5 seconds. Example: A homepage features a news ticker that scrolls headlines. A "Pause" button allows users to stop the scrolling. </p>
<ul>
<li>Good Example: The banner includes controls to pause the animation and close the ad.</li>
<li>Bad Example: A flashing banner ad loops endlessly without any controls to stop or hide it.</li>
</ul>
<li>2.2.3 No Timing (AAA)</li>
<p>Content must not require timing for interaction, unless essential. Example: An educational quiz allows users to take as much time as they need for each question, with no countdown or forced pacing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Example: The same app provides a setting to remove all time limits for each task.</li>
<li>Bad Example: A language-learning app gives only 10 seconds per question and doesn't allow changes.</li>
</ul>
<li>2.2.4 Interruptions (AAA)</li>
<p>Users should be able to postpone or suppress interruptions, except in emergencies. Example: A project management app delays non-urgent notifications like "New comment added" until the user finishes their current task.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Example: The app queues notifications and shows them only after the user submits the form.</li>
<li>Bad Example: A pop-up about a new feature appears in the middle of a user's form entry and disrupts their work.</li>
</ul>
<li>2.2.5 Re-authenticating (AAA)</li>
<p>When a session expires, the user must be able to re-authenticate and continue without losing their data. Example: A user is filling out a grant application form. After re-logging in, the site restores their answers so they can continue from where they left off.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Example: The form auto-saves progress, and after re-authentication, the user resumes with their data intact.</li>
<li>Bad Example: The form times out after 10 minutes, and all entered information is lost upon re-login.</li>
</ul>
<li>2.2.6 Timeouts (AAA)</li>
<p>If a timeout is used, users must be informed of the duration and whether they can extend it. Example: A banking app logs users out after 5 minutes. Before timeout, it displays a warning and offers a “Stay Logged In” button.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Example: The app shows a countdown and gives the user a choice to stay logged in.</li>
<li>Bad Example: A user gets logged out without any prior notice, losing unsaved work.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<h2>Examples of Guideline 2.3: Seizures and Physical Reactions</h2>
<p>Guideline 2.3 of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) ensures that web content does not cause seizures or physical reactions in users. This is especially important for people with photosensitive epilepsy or vestibular disorders. The goal is to avoid flashing content and unnecessary motion that could trigger harmful responses.</p>
<p>Here are examples of how to meet Guideline 2.3:</p>
<ol>
<li>2.3.1 Three Flashes or Below Threshold (A)</li>
<p>Web pages must not contain anything that flashes more than three times in any one-second period, unless the flashing is below the general flash and red flash thresholds. Example: An animation effect in a game flashes a light only once every few seconds, and stays well below the threshold that could trigger seizures.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Example: The game uses subtle fade transitions or slow glows that do not flash excessively.</li>
<li>Bad Example: A game features rapid strobe effects during transitions that flash more than 3 times per second.</li>
</ul>
<li>2.3.2 Three Flashes (AAA)</li>
<p>Web pages must not contain anything that flashes more than three times in any one-second period — regardless of whether it is below the flash threshold. Example: An animated advertisement uses a soft fade in/out effect rather than flashing lights to draw attention.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Example: The ad uses gentle transitions and motion without flashing elements.</li>
<li>Bad Example: An ad banner rapidly flashes text and colors to attract users, exceeding three flashes per second.</li>
</ul>
<li>2.3.3 Animation from Interactions (AAA)</li>
<p>Motion animation triggered by user interaction must be able to be disabled, unless it is essential to the functionality or information being conveyed. Example: A submit button shows a bouncing animation after a click. Users can turn off animations in accessibility settings.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Example: The app provides a “Reduce Motion” setting to stop non-essential animations like shaking or bouncing.</li>
<li>Bad Example: When a user clicks a button, it triggers a shaking animation that cannot be disabled, possibly causing motion sickness.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<h2>Examples of Guideline 2.4: Navigable</h2>
<p>Guideline 2.4 of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) ensures that users can easily navigate, find content, and know where they are within a website or application. This is particularly helpful for users with visual impairments, cognitive challenges, or those using screen readers and keyboard navigation.</p>
<p>Here are examples of how to meet Guideline 2.4:</p>
<ol>
<li>2.4.1 Bypass Blocks (A)</li>
<p>A mechanism must be provided to skip repeated content, like navigation menus, and go directly to the main content. Example: A website has a “Skip to main content” link at the top of every page that moves focus to the body of the content.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Example: The first tab stop is a "Skip to content" link that takes users past the navigation.</li>
<li>Bad Example: Users must tab through the full navigation menu every time they load a page.</li>
</ul>
<li>2.4.2 Page Titled (A)</li>
<p>Web pages must have descriptive titles that describe their topic or purpose. Example: A news article page has the title: “Local Election Results – April 2025 | Daily Times.”</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Example: The title clearly says what the page is about, like “Contact Us – ABC Services.”</li>
<li>Bad Example: The page title is simply “Untitled Document” or “Page 1.”</li>
</ul>
<li>2.4.3 Focus Order (A)</li>
<p>The focus must move in a logical order that preserves meaning and operability. Example: A form moves through fields in the expected top-to-bottom, left-to-right order.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Example: Tabbing through the page follows a natural, logical sequence.</li>
<li>Bad Example: Pressing the tab key jumps from the top of the page to the footer, then back up to the middle content.</li>
</ul>
<li>2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context) (A)</li>
<p>The purpose of each link should be clear from its context. Example: In a list of news headlines, each link says the full article title like “Read more about climate change policies.”</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Example: Links are specific, like “Download Annual Report (PDF).”</li>
<li>Bad Example: Links say only “Click here” with no additional context.</li>
</ul>
<li>2.4.5 Multiple Ways (AA)</li>
<p>More than one method must be available to locate a web page within a set of pages. Example: A site has both a navigation menu and a search box to help users find content.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Example: The site includes a menu, site map, and search function.</li>
<li>Bad Example: Users can only navigate using a linear menu with no search or sitemap.</li>
</ul>
<li>2.4.6 Headings and Labels (AA)</li>
<p>Headings and labels must be descriptive and help users understand the purpose of content. Example: A form includes labels like “Email Address” and section headings like “Billing Information.”</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Example: Labels clearly describe the input, such as “Full Name” and “Phone Number.”</li>
<li>Bad Example: A form uses vague labels like “Field 1” and “Field 2.”</li>
</ul>
<li>2.4.7 Focus Visible (AA)</li>
<p>Any interface component that can receive keyboard focus must have a visible indication of focus. Example: When tabbing through a site, each button and link shows a visible blue outline.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Example: Focused elements are clearly outlined or highlighted visually.</li>
<li>Bad Example: Tabbing through links gives no visual indication of where the focus is.</li>
</ul>
<li>2.4.8 Location (AAA)</li>
<p>Users must be able to determine their location within a website. Example: A blog shows breadcrumb navigation like “Home > Blog > Accessibility Tips.”</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Example: Breadcrumbs or page headers show users their location.</li>
<li>Bad Example: No indicators show users what section or page they are on.</li>
</ul>
<li>2.4.9 Link Purpose (Link Only) (AAA)</li>
<p>The purpose of each link must be clear from the link text alone, without relying on surrounding context. Example: A list of links includes: “Annual Report (PDF),” “Staff Directory,” and “Company News.”</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Example: Each link is self-explanatory like “Register for April Workshop.”</li>
<li>Bad Example: Links only say “More info” or “Details” without additional context.</li>
</ul>
<li>2.4.10 Section Headings (AAA)</li>
<p>Section headings must be used to organize content and make it easier to navigate. Example: A long article is broken into sections with headings like “Introduction,” “Methodology,” and “Conclusion.”</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Example: Proper heading tags (e.g., h2, h3) are used to structure content logically.</li>
<li>Bad Example: A webpage has no headings at all, making it difficult for screen reader users to scan.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<h2>Guideline 2.5: Input Modalities</h2>
<p>Guideline 2.5 of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) focuses on ensuring that users can interact with functionality using different input methods beyond just the keyboard, such as touch, voice, and assistive technologies. It helps accommodate users with physical or motor disabilities by making controls easy to operate.</p>
<p>Here are examples of how to meet Guideline 2.5:</p>
<ol>
<li>2.5.1 Pointer Gestures (A)</li>
<p>All functionality that uses complex gestures (e.g., multi-finger or path-based) must also be operable with a single-point activation (like a single tap). Example: A photo gallery allows zooming in by pinching or by using on-screen zoom buttons.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Example: Users can either pinch or tap a “+” button to zoom in.</li>
<li>Bad Example: Users must pinch to zoom, and there's no other way to zoom.</li>
</ul>
<li>2.5.2 Pointer Cancellation (A)</li>
<p>Functionality that triggers on a pointer down-event (e.g., mouse click or touch) must provide a way to cancel it before it is completed. Example: A user presses a "Delete" button, but the action only completes on releasing the pointer, giving time to move the pointer away to cancel.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Example: The delete only occurs on pointer release, and the pointer can be moved away to cancel.</li>
<li>Bad Example: The delete action happens immediately on pressing down, with no way to undo.</li>
</ul>
<li>2.5.3 Label in Name (A)</li>
<p>For interface components with labels that are visible on the screen, the accessible name must match or include the visible label text. This supports voice input users who rely on visible text to activate controls. Example: A button visually says “Submit Form” and its accessible name (aria-label) is also “Submit Form.”</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Example: The visible and programmatic names match — both say “Search.”</li>
<li>Bad Example: The visible label says “Search,” but the accessible name is “Find.”</li>
</ul>
<li>2.5.4 Motion Actuation (A)</li>
<p>Functionality that is triggered by device motion (like shaking or tilting) must also be available through standard controls. Example: A mobile app shakes to undo an action, but also includes an “Undo” button.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Example: The same function can be accessed by pressing a clearly labeled button.</li>
<li>Bad Example: The only way to undo is by shaking the device.</li>
</ul>
<li>2.5.5 Target Size (AAA)</li>
<p>The clickable area of interactive elements must be at least 44x44 CSS pixels, unless it’s within a sentence or there is an equivalent control. Example: Touch targets like buttons and links are large enough to tap easily, even for users with limited motor control.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Example: Buttons are spaced out and large enough to activate comfortably.</li>
<li>Bad Example: Tiny icons or buttons that are hard to tap precisely.</li>
</ul>
<li>2.5.6 Concurrent Input Mechanisms (AAA)</li>
<p>Users must be able to switch between different input methods, like keyboard, mouse, or touch, without losing functionality. Example: A drawing application works with both mouse and touch inputs seamlessly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Example: Users can switch between mouse and touch freely without any issues.</li>
<li>Bad Example: The app only works with a mouse and fails to respond to touch.</li>
</ul>
