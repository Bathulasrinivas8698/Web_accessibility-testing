<h1>Robust </h1>
<p>The principle of Robust is the fourth and final principle of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). It ensures that content can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies. This principle focuses on building content that is technically sound, follows standard coding practices, and remains accessible as technology evolves.</p>
<p>Under the Robust principle, there is one main guideline that ensures digital content is developed using proper coding techniques so that it remains usable across different platforms, browsers, and assistive tools like screen readers.</p>
<ol>
<li>Compatible - Maximize compatibility with current and future user agents, including assistive technologies. This includes writing clean and valid code, using proper semantics, labeling elements correctly, and ensuring that web technologies (HTML, ARIA, etc.) are implemented in a way that supports accessibility tools effectively.</li>
</ol>
<p>The guideline includes Success Criteria that require developers to follow standards for coding and ensure that user input components are identifiable and accessible programmatically. This is crucial for ensuring long-term accessibility, especially as browsers and assistive technologies update over time.</p>
<h2>Guidelines of Success Criteria</h2>
<p>There are a total of 3 Success Criteria (SC) under the Robust principle.</p>
<ol>
<li>Guideline 4.1: Compatible</li>
<ul>
<li>4.1.1 Parsing (A)</li>
<li>4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (A)</li>
<li>4.1.3 Status Messages (AA)</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<p>With the Robust principle, developers ensure that web content works seamlessly with both current and emerging technologies, which is vital for long-term accessibility and compatibility.</p>
<h2>Examples of Guideline 4.1: Compatible</h2>
<p>Guideline 4.1 of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) ensures that content is robust enough to be reliably interpreted by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies. This principle helps ensure future compatibility as technologies evolve.</p>
<p>Here are examples of how to meet Guideline 4.1:</p>
<ol>
<li>4.1.1 Parsing (A)</li>
<p>Ensure that HTML or XML content is properly coded so that it can be reliably parsed by browsers and assistive technologies. Example: A webpage uses properly nested HTML tags and closes all elements correctly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Example: All tags are properly opened and closed. Elements are nested in a logical order.</li>
<li>Bad Example: A <div> tag is opened but never closed, causing screen readers to misinterpret the page layout.</li>
</ul>
<li>4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (A)</li>
<p>User interface components must have appropriate names, roles, and values that can be programmatically determined and used by assistive technologies. Example: A custom checkbox component correctly exposes its role (checkbox), state (checked/unchecked), and name (label text) to screen readers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Example: The button is coded with ARIA roles and labels so assistive technology identifies it correctly as a button.</li>
<li>Bad Example: A custom-built button visually looks clickable but doesn’t announce itself as a button to a screen reader.</li>
</ul>
<li>4.1.3 Status Messages (AA)</li>
<p>Status messages (such as errors or success confirmations) must be programmatically exposed to assistive technologies without receiving focus. Example: A message like “Form submitted successfully” is announced by the screen reader when it appears on the screen.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Example: The message is coded with aria-live="polite" so screen readers read it aloud automatically.</li>
<li>Bad Example: A confirmation message appears visually but is not announced by the screen reader.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
