<h1> guideline</h1>
<p>The principle of Perceivable is the first guideline of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and ensures that all users can perceive the content of a website or application. This principle focuses on making information and user interface components available to the senses of sight, sound, and touch.</p>
<p>Under the Perceivable principle, there are four guidelines that help ensure digital content is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. These guidelines are.</p>
<ol>
<li>Text Alternatives – Provide text alternatives for non-text content, such as images, audio, and video, so that assistive technologies can present the information in an accessible format.</li>
<li>Time-Based Media – Offer alternatives for time-based media, such as captions for videos and transcripts for audio content, to support users who are deaf or hard of hearing.</li>
<li>Adaptable – Create content that can be presented in different ways without losing information or structure, such as ensuring proper heading structures and flexible layouts.</li>
<li>Distinguishable – Ensure content is easy to see and hear, using sufficient color contrast, resizable text, and the ability to adjust audio settings.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these guidelines includes several Success Criteria that provide measurable requirements for compliance at different WCAG levels (A, AA, AAA). These criteria help developers and designers create web content that is accessible to people with visual, auditory, and other sensory impairments.</p>

<h2>Examples of guideline 1.1</h2>
<p> Guideline 1.1 of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) focuses on Providing Text Alternatives for non-text content to ensure accessibility for users with disabilities, including visually impaired individuals who rely on screen readers.</p>
<p>There are six main types of images as per WCAG Guideline 1.1: Providing Text Alternatives. Each type requires different handling for accessibility.</p>
<ol>
<li>Informative Images</li>
<p>Informative images convey important content that enhances understanding. These images provide visual details that add meaning to the surrounding text. For example, a photograph of Albert Einstein in a biography article serves to show what he looked like at a particular time. A good text alternative should describe the image’s purpose, such as "Albert Einstein in 1921, wearing a suit and bow tie." A bad example would be using a vague alt text like "Einstein" or leaving it empty, as this does not provide meaningful information to visually impaired users.</p>
<li>Decorative Images</li>
<p>Decorative images are purely aesthetic and do not add meaning to the content. They are often used for visual appeal, such as background patterns, borders, or ornamental graphics. Since they do not convey any useful information, their alt attribute should be left empty, ensuring that screen readers skip them. A bad practice would be adding unnecessary alt text like "Fancy border image," which could be distracting for screen reader users. Instead, simply setting the alt attribute to empty, such as alt="", allows assistive technologies to ignore the image.</p>
<li>Functional Images</li>
<p>Functional images serve an interactive purpose, such as acting as buttons, links, or controls. For example, a search icon should have an alt text like "Search" so that users know its function. If the alt text is left empty or is too vague, such as "Icon," users may not understand what action the image performs. Providing clear and concise descriptions ensures that users relying on assistive technology can navigate the website effectively.</p>
<li>Complex Images (Graphs, Charts, Diagrams, Maps)</li>
<p>Complex images convey data and require a detailed description. These include charts, infographics, and diagrams that present information visually. For example, a bar chart showing population growth should have an alt text like "Bar chart showing population growth from 2010 to 2020, increasing by 30%." A poor example would be simply stating "Chart" or "Graph," as it does not provide the necessary context. When possible, a long description or a textual data summary should also be provided for better accessibility.</p>
<li>Text Images</li>
<p>Text images contain written content embedded within an image. Since screen readers cannot interpret text inside images, an accurate alternative text should be provided. For instance, an image of a motivational quote should have an alt text that includes the full quote, such as "The only limit to our realization of tomorrow is our doubts of today. - Franklin D. Roosevelt." A bad example would be using a generic alt text like "Quote image," which does not convey the message contained within the image. If possible, using actual text instead of an image is recommended for better accessibility.</p>
<li>Image CAPTCHAs</li>
<p>Image CAPTCHAs are used to verify whether a user is human, often by displaying distorted letters or numbers. These pose a challenge for visually impaired users, as screen readers cannot interpret them. A poor example would be using an alt text like "Captcha image," which does not help the user complete the task. The best practice is to provide an alternative method, such as an audio CAPTCHA or a text-based challenge, to ensure accessibility for all users.</p>
</ol>
<h2>Examples of guideline 1.2</h2>
<p>Guideline 1.2 of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) focuses on providing alternatives for time-based media, such as audio and video content, so that users with disabilities, including those who are visually or hearing impaired, can access the information.</p>
<ol>
<li>1.2.1 Audio-Only and Video-Only - Prerecorded (AA)</li>
<p>A podcast episode discusses financial planning tips. Since there is no visual content, a full transcript is provided on the website for users who are deaf or prefer reading.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Example: A downloadable text transcript is available that includes the full conversation and speaker names.</li>
<li>Bad Example: The podcast has no transcript, preventing accessibility for people who cannot hear.</li>
</ul>
<li>1.2.2 Captions - Prerecorded (A)</li>
<p>A university uploads an online lecture video where the professor explains key concepts. To make it accessible for deaf or hard-of-hearing students, closed captions are provided.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Example: The video includes synchronized captions that display the spoken words and relevant sounds (e.g., "[Applause]" or "[Laughter]").</li>
<li>Bad Example: The video has no captions, making it inaccessible to users with hearing impairments.</li>
</ul>
<li>1.2.3 Audio Description or Media Alternative - Prerecorded (A)</li>
<p>A documentary features visuals of landscapes and historical buildings, with background music but no spoken narration. To assist visually impaired users, an audio description is added, describing key visual elements.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Example: An alternative version of the video includes an audio description that narrates what is happening on screen.</li>
<li>Bad Example: The documentary plays music over visuals without explaining the scenes to blind users.</li>
</ul>
<li>1.2.4 Captions - Live (AA)</li>
<p>A company hosts a live webinar about new business trends. To accommodate deaf or hard-of-hearing participants, real-time captions are provided.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Example: A live captioning service transcribes the speaker’s words in real time.</li>
<li>Bad Example: The webinar is broadcast without captions, making it inaccessible.</li>
</ul>
<li>1.2.5 Audio Description (Prerecorded) (AA)</li>
<p>A university records a science experiment demonstration where a professor mixes two chemicals, causing a color change and smoke to appear. Since this is important information for understanding the video, an audio description is added.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Example: An audio description is provided, The professor pours a clear liquid into a beaker. The solution slowly turns blue, then begins to produce thick white smoke.</li>
<li>Bad Example: The professor mixes the chemicals silently, and there is no explanation of what happens.</li>
</ul>
<li>1.2.6 Sign Language - Prerecorded (AA)</li>
<p>A government website provides a video tutorial explaining how to file taxes online. To assist users who use sign language, a sign language interpreter is shown in the corner of the video.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Example: A sign language interpreter is visible on-screen, making the content more accessible.</li>
<li>Bad Example: The video only has voice narration and no sign language support.</li>
</ul>
<li>1.2.7 Extended Audio Description (Prerecorded) (AAA)</li>
<p>A history documentary about ancient Egyptian artifacts includes scenes with detailed carvings and inscriptions that are crucial to understanding the video. However, the narrator is speaking continuously, leaving no time to insert audio descriptions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Example: The video pauses at key moments, and an extended audio description explains: The camera zooms in on a stone tablet with intricate hieroglyphics. The carvings depict a pharaoh standing before the sun god Ra, offering a golden scepter.</li>
<li>Bad Example: No additional description is provided, so blind users miss out on the visual details.</li>
</ul>
<li>1.2.8 Media Alternative (Prerecorded) (AAA)</li>
<p>A business training video explains how to manage customer complaints through role-playing scenarios. Some users may not be able to watch or hear the video, so a full media alternative is required.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bad Example: The website only provides captions, with no text transcript of actions or visuals.</li>
<li>Good Example: A full script is available that includes: All dialogue, Descriptions of character actions, Key visual cues, Background noises.</li>
</ul>
<li>1.2.9 Audio-only (Live) (AAA)</li>
<p>A company hosts a live audio-only investor call, where executives discuss quarterly earnings.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Example: A real-time text transcript is available, updated as speakers talk. This could be done via: Live captioning services and A stenographer providing real-time transcription. </li>
<li>Bad Example: The company provides no transcript, leaving deaf or hard-of-hearing users unable to follow.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<h2>Examples of Guideline 1.3: Adaptable</h2>
<p>Guideline 1.3 ensures that content is structured in a way that allows assistive technologies (such as screen readers) to interpret and present the information properly. This means using proper headings, labels, tables, and semantic HTML so that content remains accessible and adaptable to different devices and user needs.</p>
<ol>
<li>1.3.1 Info and Relationships (A)</li>
<p>Information that is visually structured (such as tables, headings, and lists) must, Example: A university website displays a course schedule.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Example: The schedule is structured properly, with clear headings like "Course Name," "Instructor," and "Time," so screen readers can read it in a logical order.</li>
<li>Bad Example: The schedule is presented as plain text without clear labels, making it difficult for screen reader users to understand which information belongs to which column.</li>
</ul>
<li>1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence (A)</li>
<p>The content must be presented in a logical reading order that makes sense when Example: A news website displays a headline, an image, and a paragraph of text.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Example: The headline appears first, followed by the image, and then the paragraph, ensuring the content is understood as intended.</li>
<li>Bad Example: The paragraph appears first in the reading order before the headline, making it confusing for users who rely on screen readers.</li>
</ul>
<li>1.3.3 Sensory Characteristics (A)</li>
<p>Instructions should not rely only on visual cues such as color, shape, or position because not all users can perceive them. Example: A website provides instructions for navigating a form by saying, "Click the red button to continue.</p>
<UL>
<LI>Good Example: The button includes both text and a label, such as "Click the button labeled ‘Continue’," so users can identify it even if they can't see the color.</li>
<li>Bad Example: The button is only identified by its color, making it inaccessible to colorblind users.</li>
</ul>
<li>1.3.4 Orientation (A)</li>
<p>Content must be usable in both portrait and landscape modes. Example: A mobile banking app is designed to work only in landscape mode.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Example: The app works in both portrait and landscape modes, adapting to the user's preference.</li>
<li>Bad Example: Users who cannot rotate their devices, such as those using a wheelchair-mounted tablet, cannot access the app properly.</li>
</ul>
<li>1.3.5 Identify Input Purpose (AA)</li>
<p>Form fields should be designed so that assistive technologies can recognize their purpose and help users fill them out. Example: An online shopping website asks for the user's name, email, and address.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Example: The form allows autofill and clearly labels each input field (such as "Full Name," "Email Address," and "Shipping Address"), so screen readers and password managers can assist users.</li>
<li>Bad Example: The form does not provide hints or allow autofill, making it harder for users with disabilities to complete it.</li>
</ul>
<li>1.3.6 Identify Purpose (AAA)</li>
<p>Icons, buttons, and interactive elements should have clear descriptions so assistive technologies can understand their function. Example: A music player app has buttons for play, pause, and volume, represented only by symbols.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Example: Each button has a clear label, such as "Play," "Pause," and "Increase Volume," so assistive technologies can describe them properly.</li>
<li>Bad Example: The buttons have no text labels, making it difficult for screen reader users to know what each button does.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<h2>Guideline 1.4: Distinguishable</h2>
<p>Guideline 1.4 ensures that content is easy to see and hear by separating foreground from background, improving contrast, and allowing users to adjust text and multimedia presentation.</p>
<ol>
<li>1.4.1 Use of Color (A)</li>
<p>Color should not be the only way of conveying meaning, as users with color blindness or low vision may not perceive it correctly. Example: A form highlights errors using only red text.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Example: The error message is accompanied by an icon and text, such as "Error: Please enter a valid email address," making it accessible to all users.</li>
<li>Bad Example: The error message is displayed in red without any additional indication. A colorblind user may not notice the issue.</li>
</ul>
<li>1.4.2 Audio Control (A)</li>
<p>Users should be able to pause, stop, or adjust the volume of audio that plays for more than 3 seconds. Example: A website automatically plays background music.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Example: The website provides a clear button to pause or mute the audio, allowing users to control their experience.</li>
</li>Bad Example: The audio plays without an option to pause, making it difficult for users to focus on reading the content.</li>
</ul>
<li>1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) (AA)</li>
<p>Text and images of text should have sufficient contrast against their background for readability. Example: A news article displays black text on a dark gray background.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Example: The text is displayed in black on a white background, ensuring clear visibility.</li>
<li>Bad Example: The contrast is too low, making it hard to read for users with visual impairments.</li>
</ul>
<li>1.4.4 Resize Text (AA)</li>
<p>Users should be able to enlarge text up to 200% without losing functionality or readability. Example: A website uses small text that cannot be resized. </p>
<ul>
<li>Good Example: The website’s text scales properly when zoomed in, ensuring readability without breaking the layout.</li>
<li>Bad Example: The text becomes cut off or overlaps when users zoom in, making it unreadable.</li>
</ul>
<li>1.4.5 Images of Text (AA)</li>
<p>Text should be displayed as real text, not embedded in images, so it can be resized and read by assistive technologies. Example: A poster with event details is shared as an image.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Example: The event details are provided in actual text alongside the image so that all users can read them.</li>
<li>Bad Example: The event information is in an image without alternative text, making it inaccessible to screen reader users.</li>
</ul>
<li>1.4.6 Contrast (Enhanced) (AAA)</li>
<p>Text should have an even higher contrast ratio for users with low vision. Example: A website has light gray text on a white background.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Example: The text is dark gray or black on a white background, improving readability.</li>
<li>Bad Example: The contrast is too weak, making it hard for visually impaired users to read.</li>
</ul>
<li>1.4.7 Low or No Background Audio (AAA)</li>
<p>Audio should be clear, with minimal background noise, to help users with hearing impairments. Example: A video tutorial has loud background music. </li>
<ul>
<li>Good Example: The video ensures clear narration with minimal background noise.</li>
<li>Bad Example: The background music overpowers the speaker’s voice, making it difficult to understand.</li>
</ul>
<li>1.4.8 Visual Presentation (AAA) </li>
<p>Users should be able to customize text appearance, such as font size, color, and spacing, for better readability. Example: A website has fixed text styles and spacing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Example: The site allows users to adjust font size and spacing for a more comfortable reading experience.</li>
<li>Bad Example: The text is cramped and cannot be adjusted, making it difficult to read.</li>
</ul>
<li>1.4.9 Images of Text (No Exception) (AAA)</li>
<p>Text should never be embedded in images unless essential. Example: A menu is displayed as an image instead of real text.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Example: The menu is provided in real text, ensuring accessibility.</li>
<li>Bad Example: Users cannot copy, resize, or have the menu read aloud by a screen reader.</li>
</ul>
<li>1.4.10 Reflow (AAA)</li>
<p>Content must adapt to different screen sizes without requiring users to scroll in multiple directions (both horizontally and vertically). Example: A blog page is designed with a fixed width.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Example: The content reflows properly, adjusting to fit smaller screens without horizontal scrolling, improving accessibility for all users.</li>
<li>Bad Example: When viewed on a mobile device, the user has to scroll horizontally to read each line, making it difficult for those with limited mobility.</li>
</ul>
<li>1.4.11 Non-Text Contrast (AAA)</li>
<p>UI components (such as buttons, icons, and form controls) must have enough contrast to be easily distinguishable. Example: A submit button on a form is a light gray color against a slightly darker gray background.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Example: The button has a high contrast color (such as dark blue on a white background), ensuring it stands out clearly.</li>
<li>Bad Example: The contrast is too low, making it hard for users with low vision to locate the button.</li>
</ul>
<li>1.4.12 Text Spacing (AAA)</li>
<p>Users must be able to increase text spacing (line height, letter spacing, word spacing, and paragraph spacing) without losing functionality or readability. Example: A long article on a website has tightly packed text.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Example: The site allows for text spacing adjustments, ensuring no loss of readability when spacing is increased.</li>
<li>Bad Example: When users adjust the text spacing using browser settings or custom stylesheets, words overlap, making it unreadable.</li>
</ul>
<li>1.4.13 Content on Hover or Focus (AAA)</li>
<p>When additional content (such as tooltips, pop-ups, or dropdown menus) appears on hover or focus, users should be able to easily dismiss it and still access the underlying content. Example: A shopping website displays product details in a tooltip when a user hovers over a product name.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Example: The tooltip remains visible until the user moves focus away or presses the "Esc" key, giving them time to read the content.</li>
<li>Bad Example: The tooltip disappears immediately when the cursor moves, making it hard for users with motor impairments to read the information.</li>
</ul>
