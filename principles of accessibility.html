<h1>Accessibility principle</h1>
<p>The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are built upon four foundational principles, often summarized by the acronym POUR.</p>
<ol>
<li>Perceivable: Information and user interface components must be presented to users in ways they can perceive.</li>
<li>Operable: User interface components and navigation must be operable; users should be able to interact with all controls and interactive elements.</li>
<li>Understandable: Information and the operation of the user interface must be understandable; content should be clear and concise.</li>
<li>Robust: Content must be robust enough to be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.</li>
</ol>
<p>These principles serve as the foundation for web accessibility, guiding the development of content that is accessible to all users.</p>
<h2>Guidelines</h2>
<p>Under each of the four principles, there are specific guidelines that provide a framework for creating accessible web content. In WCAG 2.1, there are a total of 12 guidelines.</p>
<ul>
<li>Perceivable: 4 guidelines</li>
<li>Operable: 4 guidelines</li>
<li>Understandable: 3 guidelines</li>
<li>Robust: 1 guideline</li>
</ul>
<p>These guidelines address broad accessibility issues and lay the groundwork for the success criteria.</p>
<h3>Conformance Levels</h3>
<p>To measure and ensure accessibility, WCAG defines success criteria at three levels of conformance.</p>
<ul>
<li>Level A: The minimum level, addressing issues that have the highest impact on accessibility and are the easiest to implement.</li>
<li>Level AA: Addresses the biggest and most common barriers for users with disabilities.</li>
<li>Level AAA: The highest and most complex level, addressing the most advanced accessibility improvements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Achieving higher levels of conformance (AA or AAA) indicates that the web content is accessible to a broader range of users with disabilities.</p>
<h3>Success Criteria</h3>
<p>Each guideline is associated with testable success criteria, which are specific conditions that must be met to conform to the guidelines.</p>
<p>The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) have evolved through versions 2.0, 2.1, and 2.2, each introducing additional success criteria to enhance web accessibility. Here's a concise overview of the success criteria across these versions.</p>
<h4>WCAG 2.0</h4>
<p>Under these principles, WCAG 2.0 introduced a total of 61 success criteria. These criteria are organized into three conformance levels.</p>
<ul>
<li>Level A: 25 Success criterias</li>
<li>Level AA: 13 Success criterias</li>
<li>Level AAA: 23 Success criterias</li>
</ul>
<h4>WCAG 2.1</h4>
<p>Under these principles, WCAG 2.1 introduced a total of 78 success. criterias. These criterias are organized into three conformance levels. Introduced 17 new success criterias focusing on mobile accessibility, low vision, and cognitive disabilities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Level A: 30 Success criterias</li>
<li>Level AA: 20 Success criterias</li>
<li>Level AAA: 28 Success criterias</li>
</ul>
<h4>WCAG 2.2</h4>
<p>Under these principles, WCAG 2.1 introduced a total of 86 success. criterias. These criterias are organized into three conformance levels. Added 9 new success criterias and removed 1 obsolete criterion (4.1.1 Parsing).</p>
<ul>
<li>Level A: 31 Success criterias</li>
<li>Level AA: 23 Success criterias</li>
<li>Level AAA: 32 Success criterias</li>
</ul>
<p>For a comprehensive understanding, refer to the official WCAG documentation</p>

<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/" target=""> WCAG 2.1 Success criterias</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/" target=""> WCAG 2.2 Success criterias</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These documents provide detailed insights into each success criterion and its application, ensuring web content is accessible to a diverse range of users.</p>
<h2>abbreviations of accessibility terms</h2>
<p>Accessibility abbreviations are commonly used in discussions about digital accessibility, assistive technology, and inclusive design. These terms help professionals, developers, and users communicate effectively about accessibility features and standards.</p>
<h3>How to Use Accessibility Terms:</h3>
<ol>
<li>In Web Development: Developers use terms like WCAG, ARIA, and ALT when designing accessible websites. For example, adding ALT text to images helps screen readers describe visuals to blind users.</li>
<li>In Laws and Standards: Government agencies and organizations use abbreviations like ADA and 508 Compliance to refer to legal requirements for accessibility in digital content and services.</li>
<li>In Assistive Technology: Users of assistive tools often refer to AT, NVDA, and JAWS when discussing software that aids navigation, such as screen readers.</li>
<li>In Advocacy and Education: Organizations like NFB work to promote accessibility awareness, while VPAT documents are used to assess how well products meet accessibility standards.</li>
<li>In User Experience (UX) Design: Accessibility is a key part of UX, ensuring digital content is POUR (Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust) for all users.</li>
